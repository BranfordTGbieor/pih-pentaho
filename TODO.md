# TODO Items
==============

* Exclude test patients from the import patient query
* Consider age_years and age_at_death calculations in Import Patient.
  * Should these run later in the pipeline as value added calculations?
  * How do we keep the age_years up-to-date as time goes on if data doesn't otherwise change?
